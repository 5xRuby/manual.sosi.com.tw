## Two-Factor Authentication

### Enable Settings

> This path applies to individual users. To enable 2FA for all users, go to Site Settings.

**Reset 2FA Button:** If a user has already enabled two-factor authentication but needs to reconfigure it (e.g., due to a lost device), the administrator can click this button to allow the user to set up 2FA again upon their next login.
