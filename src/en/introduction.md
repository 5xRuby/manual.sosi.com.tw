## Core Value: The Last Mile of Cybersecurity Protection

SOSI is a high-security gateway that integrates identity authentication with remote access auditing. It addresses the three most critical challenges enterprises face during remote operations: "Who can get in?", "What can they access?", and "What did they do once inside?"

### Strongest Identity Shield

Enforces integrated LDAP authentication with site-wide two-factor authentication (2FA), ensuring accounts cannot be compromised.

### Precise Access Navigation

Through an administrator-approved authorization mechanism, users can only connect to specific devices required for their job responsibilities.

### Comprehensive Activity Monitoring

All operations are recorded via screen capture and keystroke logging, with dynamic watermarks applied, making unauthorized actions fully traceable.

### Supported Protocols

Integrates RDP, SSH, and VNC remote desktop protocols.
